# About

This directory contains intermediate files required to produce the result. Several of the scripts in the code-directory are dependent on the scripts in this directory. If an intermediate file isn't present when running the run_all.sh script it will be created. 

Example of files to stored here are:

* BAM files
* Count-matrices.
