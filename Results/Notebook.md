# About 

This notebook contains, in chronological order, the results of the performed experiments. Besides a description of the result it contains reflections, e.g ideas about why the result deviates from the expected results, about each experiment.

Each entry in this notebook should include data the experiment was performed and the name of person writing the entry. Each entry should also refer to where the resulting graph, table etc can be found.
