# About 

This notebook contains, in chronological order, the results of the performed experiments. Besides a description of the result it contains reflections, e.g ideas about why the result deviates from the expected results, about each experiment.

Each entry in this notebook should include which date the experiment was performed and the name of the author of the entry. Each entry should also refer to where the resulting graph, table etc can be found.

Created a Heat-map of based on the Poisson-distance for the Plasmid (Result/Figures/Pois_dist_heat_plasmid.pdf), see figure below:

There are no big surprises in this picture. As expected the three control samples (sample 1-3) cluster together, and the same goes for the imipenem exposed samples. Judging by the color intensity (describes the Poisson distance) it seems that the three control cases are more similar to each other than the imipenem exposed samples.
