# Data information 

## Sample data 
The sample data consists of six RNA-seq samples from E.coli K-12 transformed with the pBIC-1a plasmid. Sequencing of the data was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 in singe-read mode with 50 cycles (not paried-ends). 

The first three samples (sample 1-3) act as control and have not been exposed to the broad spectra imipenem. The last three samples (sample 4-6) have been exposed to imipenem for 10 minutes before extraction of RNA. 

The sample data was taken from ArrayExpress, association number E-MTAB-7190, 2019-02-17. The downloads links used for downloading the data are:
