## Bowtie (version 0.12.7)

Bowtie is a fast memory efficient aligner for short reads [1]. In this project Bowite version 0.12.7 is used for aligning reads. The motivation behind not using the latest version is that the paper this study aims replicates used version 0.12.7. 

The Linux version (linux-86-64) for Bowtie 0.12.7 was downloaded from this [site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie/0.12.7/?fbclid=IwAR10PfCDqwT8zkRrWg31d8bQfYW_cqfXwirRzdI2Nxlely0D3wAsIOzo2mY), using the following download link:

The script used to download Bowtie is present in the Code/Shell-directory.
