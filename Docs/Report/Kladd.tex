The aim of the project is to try reproducing your chosen study, in particular, part involving data analysis 

Write a report (max 1500-2000 words, try to be concise!) in article format (Introduction, results, discussion, methods sections at least should be there). 

code of your analysis supporting your claims and conclusion in e.g. R Markdown, deposited in your github profile

for introduction, focus on your reproducibility question. e.g. Regulation of aerobic/anaerobic growth is super important because of XYZ. Authors of the study concluded that during anaerobic growth yeast shutdowns its TCA cycle by showing downregulation of TCA cycle genes and upregulation of 28 other genes. Here we wanted to investigate whether their claim could be reproduced by reanalyzing RNA-Seq data obtained from the original study. Also, your claims and findings should be properly scientifically justified. It should be clearly stated what are the aims of your analysis.

The report and your analysis will be evaluated based on reproducilibility practices (use project structure, github and notebooks for your code), scientific reasoning, logic and communication with a reader.

Abstract: Answer "here we do, what we found and how it matters"
Introductio differs from the abstract in the following ways: it does not need to present the context (which has just been given), it is somewhat more specific about the results, and it only briefly previews the conclusion of the paper, if at all.
