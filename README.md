# Project BBT015

This project is a part of the course Advanced Bioinformatics (BBT015) at Chalmers. The aim with the project is to 
replicate a published bioinformatic paper. 

The project focues on the RNA-sequence part of a [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02929/)  with the name; *Transcriptional Landscape of a bla_KPC-2 Plasmid and Response 
to Imipenem Exposure in Escherichia coli TOP10* [1]. In the RNA-seq part of this study six *E.coli*-samples were investigated, 
and all these had been transformed with the pBIC-1a plasmid (conveys resicentence to antibiotics). Three samples acted as controlls 
while the other three had been exposed to the broad spectra Imipenem. The study investigated differences in expression levels 
between these two sample-groups, and overall it identified over 1500 differentially expressed RNA. Thus the goal with this 
project is try to replicate this, with other words the goal is to identify the same differentially RNA:s as the authors of the
paper did.
