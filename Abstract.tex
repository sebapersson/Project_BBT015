A critical aspect of any scientific study is to strengthen the reliability of the conclusions stated in the study. In order to do so, the study should be reproducible, not only by its original authors, but by other independent studies. In this study, the data analysis of an RNA-seq study with corresponding data has been reproduced and then compared to the results in the original study. The chosen study, \textit{Transcriptional Landscape of a bla$_{KPC-2}$ Plasmid and Response to Imipenem Exposure in Escherichia coli TOP10}, aimed to analyse how gene expression in a plasmid-induced \textit{E. coli}-strand is affected by the antibiotic Imipenem \cite{jousset2018transcriptional}. Not considering the plasmid, the results from this replicational study were found to be similar enough to the original findings, in E.coli. Nevertheless, the exact same results were not obtained. Whilst the results from the plasmid seemed to be similar regarding the fold change of the expression of the most significant genes, this could not be confirmed due to missing information on the gene names that were given in the original study. Therefore, the study was concluded not to be completely reproducible.

%The results from this replicational study were found to be similar to the original findings, although the exact same results were not obtained. The original study was thus found to be reproducible, with the exception of missing data on the gene names for the plasmid in the replicational study.
